//chapter 1
//question1
let a = "Sucharita";
let b = 13;
console.log(a+b);
// The answer will 'Sucharita13' since the string concatenates it.

//question2
console(typeof (a+b));
//The answer will be string since the it got concatenated so the final datatype will be string.

//Question3
const c = { name: "sucharita",
rollNo: 13};
 c = 13;
//The a will not be redeclared since it declared as const hence, the values can't be changed.

//Question4
c['friend']="Bharti";
//The keys can be changed in the const i.e we can add the values and modify the values in the const declared object but not the object itself.

//Question5
const dictionary = {
    bts: "bangtanseonyeontan",
    army:"fandom",
    festa:"anniversary celebration event"
}

console.log(dictionary.bts);

//Once the program runs then the meaning of bts(full form) will be printed.
